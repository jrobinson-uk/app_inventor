# Lesson 1 - Creating apps with Events and actions

## :speech_balloon: Introduction
In this first lesson students will sign on to [MIT App Inventor](http://appinventor.mit.edu/) and will use "Event based programming" to create their first simple app. They will also learn how to download and test their app using either an real device or an emulator.

## :books: Resources

- Student Google accounts and access to app inventor & emulator / android device.
- Teacher [Presentation](../resources/teacher.pptx)
- Magic Eight Ball (right click) - [App Template](../resources/eightBall.aia)
- Tutorial Videos - [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtQhv790NIuRkBeW1KpazKhs7FJu3mpWd)
- Magic Eight Ball [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFOracFClBg&feature=youtu.be&t=11s) & [info](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8-Ball)
- Event / Action [cardsort](../resources/event_action.pdf)


## :mortar_board: Learning Objectives
- To create a simple mobile app using **events** (*input*) and **actions**(*output*).
- To know what a virtual device is and use one to test my app.
- To apply the event / action model

## :scroll: Key Vocabulary

|Word|Definition|
|----|----------|
|Program |A collection of instructions followed by a computing device to achieve a specific goal. |
|Event|An input to a program, something that triggers an action to take place. <br> Eg A button is pressed, the device is shaken, a word is typed, a sprite collides with an edge.|
|Action|An output of a program, something it does in response to an event.<br>Eg Play a sound, change and image, vibrate, change a colour, move a sprite, increase a counter. |
|Emulator | A piece of software (Virtual Machine) designed to mimic a real phone which can be used for testing apps|


## :heavy_check_mark: Learning Outcomes

### :star: All students are able to:
- Sign into MIT App inventor with a Google Account.
- Upload the magic eight ball template app and complete it.

### :star: Most students are able to:
- Test their completed app on a virtual device.
- Extend the app in simple ways using other actions or events.- 

### :star: Some students are able to:
- Test their completed app on both a virtual and physical device.
- Extend their use of the event / action model by developing a simple sound board.

## :hourglass: Lesson Summary
- Intro to unit (aims and outcomes), what are mobile apps, name some popular ones, discuss how we might could make them and why use App Inventor.
- Unplugged activity outlining differences between procedural and event based programming.
- Show students a flowchart style plan and share instructions with students who can now develop the app.
- Show students how to test their app using the emulator and the simple provided test plan.


## :bulb: Starter
- Share the aims of the unit with class and start them thinking about apps by listing some that they use most often, try to focus on the relatively simple apps that they could make such as:

- [Yo!](http://www.justyo.co/)
- [Hold the button](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/hold-the-button/id294785375?mt=8)
- [Flappy Bird](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird)
- [Any kind of sound board](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.concapptmedia.android.soundbard2)

## :nut_and_bolt: Main Development
- Short activity to explain the difference between procedural and event driven programming. (**5-10 mins**)
- Short demo of how to log on to app inventor and tour of the basic usage, could be delivered as teacher demo or via video.
- Students follow [student instructions](../student) to build a magic eight ball app which uses a button press event to display a random message to the user.
- Some students may be able to extend the scope of the app eg add a shake event, make the app speak the message out loud or something else.
- Towards the end of their time developing prompt the students to test their app using the emulated phone (devices could be used but it's worthwhile ensuring that all students are able to use the emulator device. 

## :pencil: Plenary
- Event / Action [cardsort](../resources/actions_events.pdf) : Give students set of cards with list of events and actions of them relating to mobile devices. They should identify which are events and actions and which are commonly used together. Eg press the volume up key (event) -> increase volume by 1 notch (action)



## :thought_balloon: Home Learning / Extension

The extension activity / app for this lesson involves creating a simple soundboard which can play the sounds made by different animals as well as speak the name of those animals. 
Instructions can be found [here](ext.md).
