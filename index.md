## Introduction ##

This course is the second version of a scheme I ran last year at school. It is based around 7 x 60 minute lessons. but also includes extra material that could be used for extension / home learning. Please feel free to use / adapt / change / comment on this work as much as you like. 

Over the course of this unit students will learn how to produce some simple apps for the Android Platform. They will use an event driven visual programming language and will learn:
- To use an event driven programming language to build simple Apps
- About the uses of virtual or emulated hardware
- To use Loops and simple timer events to make thing happen over and over.
- To find and fix some examples of errors in code.
- About co-ordinate systems in computing and how they compare with everyday models.
- To create some simple procedures (*chunks of reusable code*)
- How data can be represented in different forms.
- How sensor data can be used to control the actions on screen.

## Assessment ##
Assessment is mapped to criteria laid out in the Computing at school Progression Pathways [document](http://community.computingatschool.org.uk/files/2466/original.pdf)
This document does not assign level values to the individual criteria and instead uses a series of coloured bands, it is up to the discretion of individual schools to map these to whatever reporting system their school uses.

Each lesson includes a suggested formative assessment strategy or activity to help judge the ongoing progress of the students. The unit culminates in a 2 lesson assessed task in which students select 1 of 3 tasks to complete, in which they produce an App and some associated documentation.

## Hardware and Software Requirements ##
Using app inventor is pretty straight forward and can be used in a number of ways, however 1 crucial requirement is a google account to sign in with. Ideally this will be part of a google apps for education domain, but personal accounts are sufficient.

There are 3 ways to test the apps that you and your students create are listed here in order of preference.
### Physical Device and AI Companion ##
Using a physical device is most ideal as the apps created can make use of the sensors on the device and respond to the users actions more realistically. Using a physical device also makes the created product more like an app students might run on their own device.

By far the best way to use app inventor is to connect the android device to the pupils computer and "live test" their code. This is quick and easy and enables the students to see the effects of changes they have made as they code their apps.

To set this up you will need to:
1. Connect your android device to a wireless network on the same network as the student PC's (If you don't have wifi access a cheap access point could be purchased, configured and used on an ad-hoc basis just for these lessons)
2. Install the [App Companion](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.mit.appinventor.aicompanion3&hl=en_GB) software on the android device through Google play.

For more information visit the App Inventor [Setup Page](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/setup-device-wifi.html)

### Physical device via USB###
If you do not have Wifi Access or are limited by you schools security and filtering settings then you can still use a physical device via a USB cable.

To set this up you will need to:
1. Install the App Inventor Setup Software ([Mac](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/mac.html)|[Windows](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/windows.html)) on all the Computers that students will use.
2. Depending on the device being connected you may need to install a driver for the device.
2. Install the [App Companion](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.mit.appinventor.aicompanion3&hl=en_GB) on the android device through Google play.
3. For more information visit the App Inventor [Setup Page](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/setup-device-usb.html)


### Virtual Device via Emulator###
If using a physical device isn't practical, don't worry you can still create your own apps using the emulator software. This does have it's limits (like not being able to interact with device sensors) but is sufficient for most things you might want to do.

To set this up you will need to:
1. Install the App Inventor Setup Software ([Mac](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/mac.html)|[Windows](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/windows.html)) on all the Computers that students will use.
2. Prior to testing apps, students will need to launch the aiStarter software and then launch an emulator, this can take some time to load so students should leave this open for the whole lesson.
3. For more information visit the App Inventor [Setup Page](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/setup-emulator.html)

In practice you might choose to use a combination of these approaches, ensure everyone can use the emulator software and then have a set of devices that can be shared amongst the class.
