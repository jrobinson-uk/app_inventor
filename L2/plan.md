# Lesson 2 - Using Loops and Timers

### :speech_balloon: Introduction
In this lesson students will explore how to make actions happen repeatedly using simple loops and the timer object

### :books: Resources

-Student Google accounts and access to app inventor & emulator / android device.
- Teacher [Presentation](teacher.pptx)
- Looping examples [App](resources/Loops.aia)
- Stopwatch Template - [App Template](resources/Stopwatch_template.aia)
- Stopwatch [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzavOUMpdPM)
- Event / Action [Planning Sheet](resources/planning.pdf)

### :mortar_board: Learning Objectives
- To plan the required events and actions for a scenario and adapt them when required.
- To develop a App using a timer loop.
- To increment numeric variables.

### :scroll: Key Vocabulary
|Word|Definition|
|----|----------|
|Loop |A series of instructions repeated over and over again.|
|Timer|A type of loop that happens at a regular interval|
|Variable|An area for storing data within a program, given a unique name.|
|Global Variable |A variable which is available to all parts of the program. |
|Local Variable |A variable which is only available within the event that it is created. |
|Boolean |A type of data that can have one of 2 values True(1) or False(0) |

### :heavy_check_mark: Learning Outcomes

#### :star: All students are able to:
- Identify the key events and actions of a stopwatch.
- Use a timer loop to be able make something happen repeatedly.

#### :star: Most students are able to:
- Use a timer to increment a variable and display it on screen.
- To decompose actions into small, clear steps.
- Explain what a boolean is and use it to control the state of a timer. 

#### :star: Some students are able to:
- Explain how the timer app could be changed to function as a countdown timer

### :hourglass: Lesson Summary
- Stopwatch Planning
- Recap what loops are using the [Looping Demo App](Loops.aia)
- Students create a stopwatch timer following video and [student instructions](student.md).
- Reflect on how the app could be adpated to function as a stopwatch timer.

### :bulb: Starter
Discuss the function of a stopwatch timer and identify the key events and actions, recording them on the [planning sheet](resources/planning.pdf).

- Some events are quite tangible such as button presses, others might be harder to spot.
- There may be several events link to each action, they should be broken down (**decomposed**) as much as possible.

### :nut_and_bolt: Main Development
- - Students follow [student instructions](student.md) to build a stopwatch app which uses a clock.timer event to increment a counter.
- Students must regularly and thoroughly test their app.

### :pencil: Plenary
A stopwatch often comes with a complimentary function of a countdown timer can students identify how this might change the app works in terms of events and actions. Discuss and record their ideas on their planning sheets.



### :thought_balloon: Home Learning / Extension

The extension activity / app for this lesson involves creating a simple clicking game in which the player has a limited amount of time to click a button. Similar to [Cookie Clicker](http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/) Instructions can be found [here](ext.md).
