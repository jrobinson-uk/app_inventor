# Extension Activity 3 - Easy Pool

## Introduction

For this extension activity you will create a pool like game which responds to swiping of a ball.

## Getting Started
For you app you will need:
- A canvas
- one black ball
- one white ball (smaller than the black)
- Score counter

## :one: posistion the elements
On launching the app the black ball (pocket) and the white ball should be positioned randomly apart on the canvas and should be stationary


## :two: move the ball
When the ball is swiped it should travel in the direction on the swipe at a fixed speed.


## :three: Collosions
If the ball collides with the black ball (pocket) then it should:
- disappear
- score some points
- reappear somewhere randomly

If the ball collides with the edge it should disappear and relocate somewhere without scoring points.

## :four: Ending the game
The player should receive a maximum of 10 shots before the game should stop (not be playable) and show their score.

## :five: Extending
Their are many ways to extend this app, more balls, changing sizes, moving pockets etc. How about changing the rules.
- When the player shoots they score 5 points for getting it in.
- However each time the ball hits the cushion it bounces (in a predicatable way) and they score double for each cushion that it bounces off before going in.
- If the ball doesn't hit the pocket within 5 bounces, they score 0 points
